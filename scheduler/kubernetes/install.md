## Interactive Tutorials

If you wish to get an overview of using Portworx on Kubernetes, start with [these interactive tutorials](/scheduler/kubernetes/px-k8s-interactive.html). These serve as a playground for you to get an idea about the capabilities of Portworx without having to install it in your cluster.

## Prerequisites

{% include px-prereqs.md %}.

## Install

Portworx gets deployed as a [Kubernetes DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). Following sections describe how to generate the spec files and apply them.

#### Generating the spec

{% include k8s-spec-generate.md %}

#### Internal Kvdb (beta)

Portworx can be configured to run with internal kvdb by enabling it in the above spec generator.

>**Note:** Internal Kvdb is in beta and available for PX version > 1.4

#### Applying the spec

Once you have generated the spec file, deploy Portworx.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f px-spec.yaml
```

{% include k8s-monitor-install.md %}

## Deploy a sample application

Now that you have Portworx installed, checkout various examples of [applications using Portworx on Kubernetes](/scheduler/kubernetes/k8s-px-app-samples.html).
